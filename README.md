source code and examples. The arcticle is availiable at [Practical uncertainty quantification for space-dependent inverse heat conduction problem via ensemble physics-informed neural networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735193323003299).

equation (12) is not correct, $\mathbb{E}_{\theta(\chi, d) \sim \mathscr{D}}$

should be $\mathbb{E}_{(\chi, d) \sim \mathscr{D}}$

损失函数的符号 L 和 $\mathscr{L}$ 存在混用，它们都表示损失函数，这是最终出版稿才存在的错误，作者在此深表歉意。
